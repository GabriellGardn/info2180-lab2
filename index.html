    <h2 class="articleHead1">How to Make Time For Everything You Want to Do</h2>
    <h5>August 7, 2021 by Siena Mirabella</h5>


    <img src="blogimg2.jpg">
    <p>I’ve read countless articles and watched handfuls of videos on YouTube relating to this topic, they all have very useful tips so I’ve compiled what I’ve learned through trial
         and error as well as methods I’ve picked up from content I found impactful. Here are my top 7 tips for making time for everything you want to do!</p>
    <p>Analyze Your Priorities
       This goes without saying, but nonetheless, the first thing you absolutely need to do is decipher what your main priorities actually are. This is the time where you sit down
       with your notebook, your laptop, your whiteboard, whatever it is that you work best on, and brain dump every single goal you think you want to prioritize in your head.
       Regardless of what category each goal falls in to, just write it down and deal with that out later. Warren Buffet actually has a method where you start out with writing 25
       goals out, and then you circle five of those that are your absolute top goals. Once you’ve narrowed down your goals to a select five, throw the rest away, forget
       about them because they don’t matter in comparison to your main goals, you can think about them once you’ve finished the top priorities. Your top five
       might not actually change if you have a basic list of priorities that remain important to you in the long term, but still, nothing else makes the cut right now. </p>
   
    <p>This is how you can analyze that things that come your way, you can easily look at your top
       five and see if what’s currently being thrown at you has to do with your top five priorities if not, forget them. I also have two
       main sets of priorities because let’s be honest if you’re ambitious or type A, you’re gonna want more. But usually the two
        lists are just one for my career and work-related priorities and the latter are my personal goals. This is where my personal relationship, my health, and my fitness come
       into priority.</p></article>

    <h2 class="articleHead2"> Preventing Screen-Time-Induced Headaches and Neck Pain</h2>
    <h5>May 19, 2022 by Erik Peper</h5> 
    <p>If you can identify what causes you to become tense, what your stressors are—time, emergencies, money,
       roommates, family—and learn to be aware of them, you’ll do better. Think of when you are scared—put your body in
       that position. As you do that, feel how your neck tightens. Many symptoms may disappear if you can manage to
       make yourself feel a little safer. Learn to relax the neck and shoulders. I teach my students progressive relaxation:
       Tighten muscles and then let go.</p>

    <img src="blogimg3.jpg">

    <p> When I walk, I tighten muscles to push off, and then I relax them. But working at the computer is static, and the
         muscles are held chronically at very low levels of tension. It’s boring advice, but get up and move around. Put a
          timer on your screen or use a free app called Stretch Break. Drink lots of water so you have to pee all the time.
    </p>
    <p> Stretch, wiggle, and even skip in place, and it may be helpful to look upward. We did a study on interrupting people
         at work and getting them to take exercise breaks. We compared skipping in place versus slouched walking. When
          they skipped, their energy level went way up. If they slouched and walked, their energy went down.</p>
